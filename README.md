## VPT#005-RSD
Hello dear fellow human or humanoid robot!\n\nThis is Roll Some Dice, an app developed solely for the purpose to speed up your dice rolling procedures in board games that use two dice and their respective distribution of results.

<b><font color="#efcac2">Everything is calculated locally, nothing is saved. Nobody will ever learn about your specific gam(bl)ing habits :)</font></b>
  


## Features

- :game_die::game_die: **2 Dice**: more than one! 

- :compass: **4 way display**: The result will be displayed in all 4 directions ensuring ample visibility for all players.

- :timer_clock: **Small Delay**: There is a 727ms delay between dice rolls to prevent accidental or purposeful double rolls. 



## Usage

1. Press the large red button.
2. In the next screen each tap anywhere rolls the dice.
